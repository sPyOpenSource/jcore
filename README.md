This is a micro kernel which is written in C and Assembly.

## Build target
Current is only support for x86 processors with 32bit memory address.

## Future work
Why an Java AI assistence on x86_64, ARM or RiscV processors

# Legal issues
This Java runtime environment is a clean-room implementation of the [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) specification. We have not obtained a Java license from Sun and therefore the system can not be called a Java system.
The source code is released under the GPL with an exception statement. The exception allows you to use it together with closed-source code as long as you only use the provided interface components. (see also http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html)
